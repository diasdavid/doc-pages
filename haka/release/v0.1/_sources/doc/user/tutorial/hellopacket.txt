Hellopacket
===========

Introduction
------------
Every language needs a "helloworld".
Haka, being as much a language as a network tool, needs its own helloworld, called
"hellopacket".

This "hellopacket" reads a pcap file and print a couple of tcp/ip fields of each packet in the file.

How-to
------
Launch ``hakapcap`` with a pcap file and a lua script file as arguments.

.. code-block:: console

    $ cd <haka_install_path>/share/haka/sample/hellopacket
    $ hakapcap hellopacket.pcap hellopacket.lua

Hakapcap will first dump infos about registered dissectors and
rules and then process the pcap file, outputing information on each packet (packet source
and destination, connection establishment, etc.):

Each new connection and each packet is properly logged. The pcap file is a standard format that
can be opened by various network tools, including wireshark.

Below is the content of the ``hellopacket.lua`` file:

.. literalinclude:: ../../../sample/hellopacket/hellopacket.lua
   :language: lua
   :tab-width: 4


Going further
-------------

All fields can be accessed, read and modified. The fields
are  named similarly to wireshark. For example, you can get the IP `version`, `ttl`
or `proto` simply by using ``pkt.version``, ``pkt.ttl`` or ``pkt.proto``.

.. seealso:: :lua:mod:`tcp` for a list of all tcp accessors.
